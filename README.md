# happy-birthday-esp32
This repository contains code for an ESP32 or Arduino project that plays the "Happy Birthday" song using a buzzer. The setup includes a 16x2 LCD screen that displays "Happy Birthday" and the birthday person's name with a &lt;3 symbol. Additionally, there are two LEDs that blink in sync with the melody tempo.
